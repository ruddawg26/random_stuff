Be advised these are just my notes from some of my searching around to see if there were any official documentation in regards to pentesting from different VPS providers. Use this information at your discretion, you should research it for yourself if you are concerned or some legal department wants to know. 

#### Bottomline - The consensus from what I have found online or from other pentesters, most providers don't care as long as they don't receive Abuse notifications or that you are not impacting other resources or their infrastructure. However, notifying them is always the safest best, which could be as simple as a support ticket or a form for AWS.

If you have any updates, please let me know and I will update or add to the list. I prefer to provide a link or something that backs the statements as well.

## AWS 
- Complete and submit authorization form for pentesting against owned assets in AWS or pentesting from AWS. Must use AWS root account. AWS will not grant approval through a 3rd party organization. Requests can take up to two business days.More details can be found here: https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/

## Azure 
- Encourages pentesting against organizations owned assets in the Microsoft Cloud (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement). Notifying Microsoft of pen testing activities is no longer required, customers must still follow the Rules of Engagement at the previous link (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing).  Seems that according to this Program Manager in Azure Security Engineering's blog post on Microsoft in 2016, pentesting from Azure is completely fine (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuresecurity/2016/08/29/pen-testing-from-azure-virtual-machines/)

## Linode 
- Most found information shows that Linode is fine as long as you don't affect their infrastructure and don't do anything illegal. It is recommended to put a ticket in making Linode Support Staff aware. Here are a few posts: https://www.linode.com/community/questions/161/i-am-a-security-researcher-can-i-work-with-linode, https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8enkz4/vps_providers_for_penetration_testing_bug_bounties/)
Here is a post on reddit that I think sums of everything I have read about how Linode deals and feels about pentesting from their services "If we receive an abuse complaint from the organization you are pentesting, we'll ask that you provide some verification that the testing was authorized, or have someone from that organization reach out to us." (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/59i03h/alternative_to_aws_for_port_scanningpen/)

## DigitalOcean 
- There have been recommendations by Bug bounty expert Jason Haddix that he recommends DigitalOcean (https://pentester.land/conference-notes/2018/08/02/levelup-2018-the-bug-hunters-methodology-v3.html) and response here in a digital ocean forum by a moderator implying its ok (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/is-a-penetration-tools-website-allowed). Again other people have recommended submitting a ticket to let DigitalOcean know in case any abuse requests get submitted to them.

## Google Compute 
- For your own projects on google compute you don't even need to notify them if you follow their AUP and TOS (https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6262505?hl=en, https://cloud.google.com/security/overview/). Other than this, I couldn't find anything more substantial. Sent a specific request to see if I can get an exact response. An actual google rep called me about my ticket and said that he couldn't find anything outside what I had found and was going to attempt to find out. Still waiting to find out if he was able to figure anything out. I told him many pentesters would be interested in what he finds out.

## Vultr 
- Create a support ticket notifying Vultr that the account will be used for pentesting. The more details the better, especially if the target organization makes the support request referencing the account. Then a note in the account will be made saying the account is for pentesting. However, if there are abuse requests, then they will have issues with that activity. (This information came from a support ticket request I made to get specific answers).

## Digitalfyre 
- Not authorized unless your are a verified infosec firm that has received explicit approval from their NOC. https://support.digitalfyre.com/kb/penetration-testing-restrictions/

## VPScheap 
- I asked and this was their exact response. “VPSCheap does not permit this type of activity on its network as we are unable to devote the staff time and resources to determine that said activities are lawful and permitted by the target. More information can be found in our Terms of Service (ToS), at https://vpscheap.net/tos.aspx”

## n3servers
- According to the sales and marketing director in my https://portal.n3servers.com/viewticket.php?tid=617839&c=3ZU4NxY4 requesting clarification: It is not authorized.


Another resource I found that had a list of some VPS and their authorization forms for pentesting (https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support/tickets/new)
